# End of Semester Project - Hokkaido's Cipher

## Description:
Hokkaido's Cipher is a program with two modes: encrypt & decipher or game mode.

##How does the Cipher work?
The rules of the cipher:
The code word is "Snowflake". The program will split the 26 letters of the english alphabets into groups of 3, except y & z being a group of two. Since there will be 9 groups, each group of three characters will be assigned to the letters of the code word respectively to. Since there is a group of three, for each assigned letter, there will be an assigned number. The first letter of that group is 1, the second is 2, and the 3rd is 3.
For example, the first group of letters, a-b-c, the first letter of the code word is "s". If the program was encrypting the letter "a", it would be s1 as "a" is the first letter of the group of three.

### Encrypt & Decipher Mode
This mode allows the user to encrypt or decipher any words or sentences they would like to input.

### Game mode
This game aims to educate users about the significance of safeguarding personal data through encryption. It underscores the importance of internet safety and confidentiality. Understanding the value of encrypting personal information is crucial in today's digital age, where privacy breaches and data theft are prevalent concerns.
